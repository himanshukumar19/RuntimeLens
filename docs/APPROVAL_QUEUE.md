# RuntimeLens Human Approval Queue

> **Queue Governance:** `AGENTS.md` Rule 9 (Autopilot with an Approval Queue).
> **Operational Protocol:** When an action requires human review or authorization, the agent appends a structured entry, marks the ticket `BLOCKED-ON A-xxx`, and proceeds to any unblocked offline work. When nothing unblocked remains, the agent stops and presents a digest.
> **Human Reply Format:** The user responds with:
> `APPROVE A-001, DENY A-002: <reason>`
> The agent logs decisions with dates in this file and proceeds.
